## JavaScript Getting Started (3.0/5)

This course is overall kinda confusing for you if you do not know anything about HTML and CSS
It revolves around the *Carved Rock Fitness* project, also, if you are a beginner, the project itself is very confusing.
BUT overall it explains very well about the JS fundamentals, but, of course, there are way better alternatives...
Shame because the professor is very knowledgeable.

### The Js Skeleton Project 
A simple project with live reloading for anyone who just wants to test stuff up, and understand the basics

### The Js Carved Rock Fitness 
A project based on the skeleton project, it is a responsive site, but it was build in a weird way, overengineering.
